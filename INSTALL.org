** Requirements

 - G++ (>=4.5)
 - Boost (>=1.46)
 - PETSc (>=3.1)
 - Gmsh

** Options

 - SLEPc (>=3.1), Library to solve standard and generalized eigenvalue problems.  
   Note that the version of SLEPc installed depends on the version of PETSc 
   (they have should the same release number), 
 - ANN (>=1.1.2) Approximate Nearest Neighbor
 - GLPK (>= 4.45) GNU Linear Programming ToolKit

** Building Feel++

Note that in-source builds of Feel++ are not possible.

*** Out source build

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
mkdir opt
cd opt
cmake <top level feel directory>
make
#+END_SRC

At the end of the process, you have
 - the Feel++ libraries and its dependencies compiled
 - a quickstart example solving $- \Delta u = f$ in $[0,1]^2$ with $u=g$ on $\partial \Omega$ 
   located in the quickstart/ directory
